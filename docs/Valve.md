## Overview
[Aortic regurgitation](AR.md)

# Physiology

- open- systole
    - if it doesn’t open all the way → stenosis
- closed diastole
    - if it doesn’t close all the way → regurgitation (insufficency)
    

**Stenosis: causes + complications**

- stress over time → late adulthood (> 60 yrs)
- bicuspid valve (two leaflets → more at risk of fibrosis and calcification)
- chronic rheumatic fever → repeated damaged & repair → commissural fusion → ejection click
    - mumur (due to turbulence) crescendo → decresendo
- LV must generate higher pressures → concentric left ventricular hypertrophy (new sarcomeres added in parallel) → might cause heart failure
- heart failure → syncope → chest pain (angina) *during exercise
- microangiopathic hemolytic anemia: damage to RBCs as they are forced through the smaller valve → schistocytes → haemoglobinuria

**Treatment**

- valve replacement → after onset of Sx

**Regurgitation: causes + complications**

- 50% aortic root dilation → leaflets pulled apart
    - 80% idiopathic
    - 20% aortic dissection; aneurysms; syphilis
- Valvular damage:
    - infective endocarditis
    - chronic rheumatic fever → fibrosis cant form seal
- **EARLY DECRESCENDO DIASTOLIC MURMUR**
- systole: higher blood volume → higher stroke volume → blood pumped out during systole → systolic pressure increases
- diastole: lower blood volume during diastole → lower diastolic pressure
- large pulse pressure: hyperdynamic circulation
    - bounding pulses (water-hammer)
    - head bobbing (in tune with the heartbate)
    - capillary beds of fingernails to pulsate (Quincke’s sign)
- eccentric left ventricular hypertrophy (new sarcomeres added in series)

**Treatment**

- replace valve → after onset of Sx and hypertrophy

# Aortic regurgitation

- leaking of the aortic valve of the heart that causes blood to flow in the reverse direction during ventricular diastole
- It can be caused either by disease of the aortic valve or by distortion of dilation of the aortic root and the ascending aorta

- Features:
    - early diastolic murmur: intensity of the murmur is increased by the handgrip manoeuvre
    - collapsing pulse
    - wide pulse pressure
    - Quincke’s sisng (nailbed pulsation)
    - De Musset’s sign (head bobbing)
    - mid diastolic Austin-Flint murmur in severe AR - due to partial closure of the anterior mitral valve cusps caused by the regurgitation streams
- Suspected AR should be investigated with an echo
- Management
    - medical management of any associated heart failure
    - surgery: aortic valve indications include
        - symptomatic patients with severe AR
        - asymptomatic patients with severe AR who have LV systolic dysfunction
